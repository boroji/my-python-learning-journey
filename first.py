# Create a variable called secret_num and set it to any number you'd like:

# Increase secret_num by 1

# Next, take the new number and double it

# Next, take the new number and add four to it

#Next, take the new number and divide by two

# Next, take the new number and subtract your original secret number from it

# Print the final result


# To see my magical prediction, scroll down...

secret_num = 8  # You can set this to any number you'd like
secret_num += 1  # Increase secret_num by 1
secret_num *=2  # Double the new number
secret_num += 4  # Add four to the new number
secret_num /= 2  # Divide the new number by two
final_result = secret_num - 7  # Subtract the original secret number
print(final_result)  # Print the final result
# The final result will always be 3, regardless of the initial secret_num
